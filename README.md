# AI-ChatBot
This is a full step by step code for creating an AI chatbot that can perform RAG by utilising data such as pdfs, urls etc that get stored in a vector database (in this case AstraDB).

You will need to create a .env file where you add your desired APIs and load them in and perhaps import and do updates on the requirements.txt file.
